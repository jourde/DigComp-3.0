| Cloud services                                    | Infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. All infrastructure, platforms, software, or technologies that users access through the internet without requiring additional software downloads can be considered cloud computing services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Competence statement                              | In DigComp 3.0, competence statements are short, concrete and technology-neutral descriptions of the kinds of capabilities that individuals at Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and Highly advanced levels could be expected to know or apply, for each of the 21 competences. These are shown in Section 3 of the DigComp 3.0 framework. Competence statements are based on the DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes in Annex 2 of the DigComp 3.0 framework and contain all of the key content in the learning outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Complex (task)                                    | In DigComp 3.0, the term 'complex' is used in reference to proficiency levels and learning outcomes. In these contexts, a complex task is one which is not well-defined and consists of many different and inter-connected parts, and hence is intricate and not easy to understand or complete. Complexity of a task is often described on the basis of task characteristics - however, the experience and characteristics of an individual undertaking a task is also relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Computable and non-computable problems            | The distinction between computable and non-computable problems relates to computability, i.e. the ability to determine if a specific problem can be solved by a computer, considering factors such as resources, machines, and solvability within practical limits. If a problem can be solved by a computer, it is computable. If it cannot, it is non-computable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Computational thinking                            | Computational thinking in DigComp 3.0 is consistent with the definition of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS): an individual’s ability to recognise aspects of real-world problems which are appropriate for computational formulation and to evaluate and develop algorithmic solutions to those problems so that the solutions could be operationalised with a computer.

| Pseudonymisation                                  | In the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2018), pseudonymisation refers to the processing of personal data in such a manner that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Responsible use (of digital technologies)         | The conscious, ethical, and effective use of digital technologies to maximise their benefits and minimise their risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Reality-virtuality (RV) continuum                 | Originally proposed in the 1990s for visual displays, the reality-virtuality (RV) continuum has a purely real environment at one end, consisting solely of real objects, and at the other end, a purely virtual environment, consisting solely of virtual objects. Any environment which consists of blending real and virtual objects is termed Mixed Reality (MR). Mixed reality environments where the real world is augmented with virtual content are called augmented reality (AR), while those where most of the content is virtual but there is some awareness or inclusion of real world objects are called augmented virtuality (AV). The concept was updated in 2021 to cover sensory input in addition to visual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Right to disconnect                               | Refers to a worker’s right to be able to disengage from work and refrain from engaging in work-related digital communication, such as emails or other messages, during non-work hours. This concept has developed as a result of advances in communication technologies and their impact on people’s daily lives. While there is currently no comprehensive EU-wide framework defining this right, the European Parliament passed a resolution in 2021 calling for a Directive to support this right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Robot                                             | A machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can operate with varying degrees of autonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Robotics                                          | The interdisciplinary study and practice of the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, involving aspects of computer science and engineering disciplines (such as mechanical, electrical, electronic and materials).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Simple (task)                                     | In DigComp 3.0, the term 'simple' is used in reference to proficiency levels competence statements and learning outcomes. A simple task is one which is well-defined and which consists of few parts, and hence is easy to understand and complete, and is at the opposite end of a continuum which has ‘complex’ at the other end. Note that task simplicity cannot necessarily be completely described on the basis of task characteristics - the experience and perspective of an individual undertaking a task is also relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Social engineering                                | The act of manipulating or deceiving individuals, especially using psychological persuasion, to gain access to systems containing data, documents, and information that the social engineer should not have access to obtain. Two common approaches are (i) phishing, which uses deceptive emails, websites, or messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information or installing malware; and (ii) baiting, which uses attractive advertisements or offers to entice the user into clicking on a link which contains malware or which seeks sensitive or personal data from the user. Social engineering techniques in digital environments are considered an increasingly pervasive and sophisticated threat to cybersecurity, particularly due to the application of AI technologies (e.g. voice cloning, personalising content, automated profiling). Consequences to individuals include identity theft and reputational damage. |
| Social innovation                                 | The process of developing and deploying effective solutions to challenging and often systemic social and environmental issues in support of social progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Social media                                      | A range of digital technologies that facilitate the creation, sharing and aggregation of content (such as ideas, interests, and other forms of expression) amongst virtual communities and networks. Their common features include online platforms which enable users to create and share content and participate in social networking; user-generated content; service-specific profiles; and the connection of individual user profiles to other individuals or groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Social media influencer                           | Online content creators who post content on social media or video-sharing platforms through which they impact society, public opinion and the personal views of their audience, often showcased through their authenticity-based relationship with their audience. Influencers often have a commercial intent and engage with commercial actors through different business models for monetisation purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
